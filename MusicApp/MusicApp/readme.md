## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the project.

### Set up Info.plist and GoogleService-Info.plist

Before running the project, ensure proper setup of the `Info.plist` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` files.

1. **Info.plist:**
   - Duplicate the `Info.plist` file in the `netflixUIKit` folder.
   - Rename the duplicated file to `Info-dev.plist` for development.
   - Update necessary configurations like API keys and endpoints in the `Info-dev.plist` file.

   ```bash
   cp netflixUIKit/Info.plist netflixUIKit/Info-dev.plist
   ```

2. **GoogleService-Info.plist:**
   - If the project uses Firebase or Google services, create a `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and add it to the `netflixUIKit` folder.
   - Update configurations in the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file.

   ```bash
   cp path/to/your/GoogleService-Info.plist netflixUIKit/GoogleService-Info.plist
   ```

3. **Note:**
   - Ensure that both `Info-dev.plist` and `GoogleService-Info.plist` are added to your `.gitignore` file to prevent them from being accidentally committed to version control.

### CocoaPods

Our project relies on various third-party libraries for enhanced functionality. Ensure you have CocoaPods installed, then run the following command:

```bash
pod install
```

This will install the required dependencies specified in the `Podfile`.

## Folder Structure

Our project's folder structure is designed for modularity and separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability and organization.

- **AppDelegate**: Manages the application's lifecycle events.
  
- **SceneDelegate**: Handles the setup of the app's user interface upon launching.

### Resource

- **CustomFonts**: Contains custom font files used in the application.

- **LottieFiles**: Houses Lottie animation files utilized in the app.

- **Localizable**: Holds localization files for supporting multiple languages.

- **Assets**: Stores general assets used in the application.

### Common

- **Constants**: Includes files for storing constants used throughout the app.

- **Helper**: Contains utility classes and functions that provide common functionalities.

- **Components**: Houses reusable UI components used across multiple modules.

- **Extensions**: Contains Swift extensions for extending functionality of built-in classes.

### Model

- **TMDB...etc Model**: Houses data models related to specific modules, such as TMDB models.

- **CoreData**: Contains files related to Core Data implementation.

### Network

- **APIManager**: Manages API requests and responses, providing a centralized location for networking logic.

### Module

- **SplashScreen**: Contains files specific to the splash screen module.

- **Login+Register**: Holds files for the login and registration module.

- **MainTabBar**: Includes files related to the main tab bar module.

- **AdditionalVC**: Contains additional view controllers used in various parts of the app.

### Info.plist

- Stores configuration settings and metadata for the app.

Our project's folder structure is designed to be modular and follows a clear separation of concerns. Each folder has a specific purpose, contributing to the overall maintainability and organization of the codebase. As the project evolves, consider updating the structure to accommodate new features and maintain a clean and scalable architecture.

## MVVM Design Pattern

Our project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern, a software architectural pattern that enhances separation of concerns, making the codebase more modular and maintainable.

### Model

The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It includes data structures, data access, and business rules.

### View

The View represents the user interface and is responsible for displaying data to the user and capturing user inputs. In our project, Views are implemented using UIViewController and UIView subclasses.

### ViewModel

The ViewModel acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It transforms the data from the Model into a format that is easily consumable by the View and manages user interactions, often exposing data through bindings.
